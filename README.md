# Store-Del-Luna

This is a website of my Human and Computer Interaction project with my 2 friends, Hubert Louie and Muhammad Reyhan Firmanda. This website is our portrait of a store which sells kpop stuffs online. It is a responsive web only for mobile app, unfortunately. But we believe that it's already good enough for our project.
